##  About
I am solving one LeetCode problem every day using **C#**. Although I have previously solved 47+ problems using C or C++, this repository is dedicated entirely to mastering C# syntax and .NET features while strengthening my algorithmic skills.

My goal is to complete the **NeetCode 150** list and maintain a daily streak.

## ⚠️CAUTION⚠️
When I started this series, I had only 6 days left until my finals. That's why I might have skipped posting solutions on some days.
